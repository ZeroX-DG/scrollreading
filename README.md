# What is this?

This is an add-on for a new reading experience. The main goal is to eliminate the scrolling behavior, force your eyes to scan horizontally to actually read. As you scroll, the words will be highlighted to help you focus. You can click on any word or just scroll up/down.

# But why?

Being able to scroll freely will keep you from focusing on what you read. You skim and skip the content. It also annoying and make you easily losing your focus. On books, you read better by pointing your finger on the paper and let it lead your eyes. We're doing the same thing here with the yellow highlighted words. 

# To Do

- [x] ~~Implement a new mechanics to jump between paragraphs: _for now, there will be an error if paragraphs are separated by a different tags or hidden elements, more debug needed._~~
- [ ] Tokenize with delimiters at the end: _currently, delimiters such as (:|.|,|...) are in the beginning of each token, this need to be fixed._
- [ ] Better keyboard support: _the target will be vim-like movement, with the ability to select tokens by keyboard as well._
- [ ] Configurable: _let the user changes the highlighting color, reading speed,..._
- [x] ~~A more consistent on-screen indicator when the addon is running: _for now, if we activated scroll reading mode, user have no idea what's going on.~~
- [ ] Content awareness tokenize: _nah, it's just nice to have, but will be useful._
