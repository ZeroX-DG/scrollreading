# What is this?

This is an add-on for a new reading experience. The main goal is to eliminate the scrolling behavior, force your eyes to scan horizontally to actually read. As you scroll, the words will be highlighted to help you focus. You can click on any word or just scroll up/down.

# But why?

Being able to scroll freely will keep you from focusing on what you read. You skim and skip the content. It also annoying and make you easily losing your focus. On books, you read better by pointing your finger on the paper and let it lead your eyes. We're doing the same thing here with the yellow highlighted words.
